    <p>I am a <b>Comp/Sci</b> student and I enrolled in this program because I would like to start building a professional portfolio. Additionally, I hope to improve my <em>teamwork and web development skills</em>.<br> </p>
    <p>So far, I have learned the main HTML tags and how to organize a web page into head, title, and body. Besides that, I am getting accustomed to using Atom as IDE.</p>
